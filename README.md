# MVC & Entity Framework application with CRUD interface for managing CDs
This is a ASP.NET MVC application i developed to build upon the skills i learned from my previous MVC application.
This application uses Entity Framework to manage CDs within a SQLite database instead of just a JSON file like my earlier MVC app.
I also used scaffolding for the first time in this project to generate code.
